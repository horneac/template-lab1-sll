# Assignment 1 Single Linked Lists

This is the assignment for the first lab. It has to be solved using single linked linst.
The full requirement is stated in file Instructions.docx and there is also an example in the file input.dat that 
you can use for testing the application.

In order to work on this assignment you have to clone this repository on your computer. Then create a project in C 
and try to solve the problem. After you finish, commit and push the changes. Note that you can commit (and push)
at intermediary steps (maybe you finished a function, it works and you create a commit, this way your work is saved and you can continue
coding knowing that you can come back to your latest working commit). 
The assignment is taken into consideration only if it is pushed before the deadline.

This assignment is Mandatory!
